    <h1><b>Welcome to Gravity Gap!</b></h1>
    <p>Welcome to Gravity Gap, a 2d platform game made by CMU sophomore Megan Chen and masters students Weiqi Cai, Lina Li, and Teng Zhang for the HackCMU Fall 2013 hackathon.</p>
    <p>Use the left and right arrow keys to move, and the up arrow key to glide upwards against the gravity.</p>
    <p>Your mission, shall you choose to accept it, is to fight against the gravity pushing down on you in each level, while trying to make it to the other side of the level without crashing into the fiery red blocks.</p>
